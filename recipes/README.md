## Introduction

The goal of the Odin Recipes project is to build a simple recipe website. By completing this project, I will demonstrate the following skills:

- HTML: I will create the structure and layout of the web pages using HTML markup.
- Git and Version Control: I will use Git to track changes, manage project versions, and collaborate with others.
- GitHub: I will host my project on GitHub and use it for version control and project management.
- Command Line: I will use the command line to navigate directories, clone repositories, and run basic Git commands.
## Project Structure

The "odin-recipes" project consists of the following files and directories:

- index.html: The main homepage of the recipe website.
- recipes/: A directory that contains individual recipe pages.
- img/: A directory to store images used in the project.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
